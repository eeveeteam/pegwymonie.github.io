Action Points are a measure of your characters ability to act under pressure. Characters generally start with the maximum amount of action point, and generally regain all points at the end of a round. As a rule of thumb,  action point is to be spent every time the dice are rolled, feats can modify this.
To Resolve an action first determine the action success threshold. This is done by adding all relevant attributes or skills, and subtracting any penalty attributes or skills. Next determine if the action is Opposed or Unopposed, resolve the action accordingly.
Opposed Actions have an aggressor, and a defender. Typically the aggressor is the initiator of the action, though feats may modify this. Each side makes a separate roll, marking their level of success. The “winner” is the one with the highest degree of success. For determining winning outcome, subtract the winning success by the defending success, if any. Since opposed actions require two rolls, each side will have to spend an action point.
Unopposed Actions are rolled with one set of dice, and have no modifications to success beyond those provided by feats.
Degree of success is a measure of how well your character succeeded at the action in question. To determine the degree of success, subtract the roll from the threshold and add one.
Critical success is a degree of success higher than 5. When you score a Critical success you may gamble any number of successes. When gambling, you make a free roll using the same modifiers before(Apply the defenders degree of success as a penalty). If the roll is successful, you gain the twice the risked successes, plus the additional successes on the roll. This may only occur once per action.

Combat is segregated into individual rounds. Each round characters may make as many actions as the action point pool allows them. Initiative determines who acts first in a round. Each character makes a free initiative roll, unless surprised, and reports their level of success. This determines their place in the turn order, ties are won by the lower roller.



Feats represent the individuality of a character, giving flavor beyond basic attributes and skills. Each feat has an associated cost, indicating the power level of the feat. Feats with a hashtag are available only with gm approval.
